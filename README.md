### NSF REU 2023 at SJSU: Machine Learning Based Cybersecurity Research Project

Award #2244597 supported research conducted by Shivani Belambe and Felicity Shih, under the guidance of project advisors Younghee Park and Fabio Di Troia, within the NSF REU Site focused on providing undergraduate research experiences for women in machine learning-based cybersecurity.

The research aimed to address cybersecurity threats posed by botnet-based attacks through the application of machine learning techniques for network intrusion detection. Specifically, the study introduced an obfuscation technique to disguise malicious traffic data, making it more challenging for detection algorithms to differentiate between benign and malicious traffic. The project goals included identifying effective methods for botnet identification, enhancing the resilience of detection systems against evasion tactics, and improving overall cybersecurity.

Datasets utilized included the CTU-13 Dataset from the Stratosphere Lab in Prague and the BOT-IoT Dataset from the Intelligent Security Group. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score were employed for evaluation. Notably, the research explored techniques such as modifying test sets to evaluate algorithm robustness, increasing the number of features for traffic classification, and employing synthetic data generation to mimic attacker behavior.

Results showed that the random forest algorithm exhibited superior performance compared to Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors, particularly in scenarios involving shuffled data and modified test sets. The study underscored the importance of pre-processing steps and dataset balancing for effective model training. Key observations included the varying computational requirements of different models and the significance of hyperparameter tuning for optimizing performance.

The research contributes to the advancement of botnet detection methodologies, highlighting the importance of machine learning in bolstering cybersecurity defenses. Key references include seminal works on botnet detection techniques and network forensics. The study concluded with acknowledgments to project advisors and team members for their contributions.

Overall, the research presents valuable insights into mitigating botnet-related cyber threats through innovative machine learning approaches, thereby advancing the security of online environments.
